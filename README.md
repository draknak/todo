# Todo
Simple vue.js todo web app

# Plans
- In the future I plan to redesign the front end,
- Add a backend (Python, nodejs or whatever im feeling at the time),
- Add a database (Some form of SQL)
- Make it more interactive (being able to drag the items)
- Being able to add sub tasks to items 
- Have a button which opens an overlay for the showing more information
- Maybe add a "in progress" option 
- Sub tasks can also be "Pending" / "In Progress" / "Complete"
- Add unit tests as well
