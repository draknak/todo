# Todo
Simple vue.js todo web app

# Plans
- In the future I plan to redesign the front end,
- Make it more interactive (being able to drag the items)
- Being able to add sub tasks to items 
- Have a button which opens an overlay for the showing more information
- Maybe add a "in progress" option 
- Sub tasks can also be "Pending" / "In Progress" / "Complete"
- Add unit tests as well

## Current Todo for project
- Finish the front and backend for dealing with boards, tasks and sub-tasks (CRUD for each of these)
- Add in moveable components - vue-draggable most likely
- looking to using passport for auth
- rework db - naming, etc...
- add dashboard (contains info surrounding points, sprints and members) and backlog pages (contains the parent task as well as owner and point value and if in sprint)
